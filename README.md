## Short-nosed sea snake study in Mardie, Western Australia
This repository contains code and input data associated with the study of the Short-nosed sea snake (<i>Aipysurus apraefrontalis</i>) in Mardie, Western Australia. This project is hosted by [BCI Minerals](https://www.bciminerals.com.au/) in coordination with [O2 Marine](https://o2marine.com.au/).

### Generating sampling design across the Mardie region
Ongoing discussions with O2 Marine led with different versions of the proposed sampling design. We present sampling design versions below for reference.

* [<b>Spatially-balanced sampling design - plain (`sbs_plain`)</b>](https://github.com/grcvhon/bci-minerals/tree/main/sampling_design/output/sbs_plain): This design was initially generated following the provision of the map of indicative sampling sites for the Short-nosed sea snake.
* [<b>Spatially-balanced sampling design with impact (`sbs_w_impact`)</b>](https://github.com/grcvhon/bci-minerals/tree/main/sampling_design/output/sbs_w_impact): This design provides a spatially-balanced survey of the region including survey of pre-determined sites: dredge and spoil grounds. The extent was also reduced to just north of the spoil grounds.

### Public documentation

Publicly-available documents related to this project are available on the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.wa.gov.au/) website of the Government of Western Australia. Quick links to these documents are also provided in the following:

* [Mardie Project](https://www.epa.wa.gov.au/proposals/mardie-project)<br>
    <sub>The proposal includes a seawater intake, evaporation ponds, processing plant, bitterns disposal pipeline and outfall, desalination plant, freshwater supply bores and associated infrastructure. The proposal would include disturbance of up to 9,365 hectares on shore, and up to 40 hectares of marine environment.</sub>

* [Optimised Mardie Project](https://www.epa.wa.gov.au/proposals/optimised-mardie-project)<br>
  <sub>The Proposal includes the expansion of the approved Mardie Project (Ministerial Statement [MS] 1175) including expanded concentrator and crystalliser ponds, an increased salt and SoP production rate, new secondary seawater intake option, a port facility laydown area, a quarry, and minor changes to the dredge channel.</sub>

* [Optimised Mardie Project - Revised Proposal](https://www.epa.wa.gov.au/proposals/optimised-mardie-project-revised-proposal)<br>
  <sub>The revised proposal includes the offshore disposal of dredge spoil within a dredge material placement area (DMPA), upgrading the existing airstrip and permitting groundwater abstraction of up to 0.7 gigalitres per year (GL/yr).</sub>
