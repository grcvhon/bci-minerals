# Generating a sampling design across the Mardie region
###### <i>*** Note: The sampling design below shows an indicative approach and is therefore NOT final.</i>

<br>

We will generate a spatially balanced sampling design across the Mardie region while taking into account indicative Short-nosed sea snake sampling sites as presented in the image below. That is, our design will prioritise these identified sites when generating our design.

Here, "spatially balanced" means that the sites we will place within the survey boundary (approximated from the map above)will yield adequate, representative data of the sea snakes that occur in the area.
