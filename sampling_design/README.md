# Generating a sampling design across the Mardie region
###### <i>*** Note: The sampling design below shows an indicative approach and is therefore NOT final.</i>

<br>

We will generate a spatially balanced sampling design across the Mardie region while taking into account indicative Short-nosed sea snake sampling sites as presented in the image below. That is, our design will prioritise these identified sites when generating a spatially balance design.

Here, "spatially balanced" means that we have placed sampling sites within our survey boundary that will yield data which will adequately represent the diversity (and potentially abundance) of the Short-nosed sea snake (as well as other sea snake species) in the area.
